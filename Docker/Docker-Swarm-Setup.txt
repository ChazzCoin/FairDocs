[Create Swarm (Run this on master/manager)] -> docker swarm init --advertise-addr 192.168.1.166
[See/List nodes in Swarm] -> docker node ls
[Docker "Run" for Services] -> docker service create --replicas 1 --name Hark-API-Cluster chazzcoin/hark-api:wsgi
[See/List services running] -> docker service ls


-> remove from swarm
sudo docker swarm leave --force

TroubleShooting:
- If docker portainer agent isn't starting, stuck in a restart loop:
    Remove that docker agent from the swarm. Start agent back up, then add swarm back.
